# Pipeline

1. Creating and saving embeddings

The pseudocode (we replace wit code blocks and flow from https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15Ra6OuNE9fcjI8eVg9OrqxE25-gAv2n2#scrollTo=ckWRI8e5n2TB

def load_corpus():
    # Load the corpus from a source (a file, a database, etc.)
    ...

def load_model(model_name):
    # Load the Transformer model
    ...

def encode_corpus(corpus, model):
    # Encode the entire corpus and return the embeddings
    ...

def save_embeddings(embeddings):
    # Save embeddings to a database
    ...

def main():
    corpus = load_corpus()
    model = load_model('model_name')
    embeddings = encode_corpus(corpus, model)
    save_embeddings(embeddings)


#### This approach separates each step into its own function for better code readability and maintainability. It also allows for flexibility in where the corpus is loaded from and how the embeddings are saved.


The previous proposal provides a solid foundation, but it could potentially be improved by including more functionality and structure, and by considering performance and reliability. Here is a refined version:

## 1. Creating and saving embeddings

The revised pseudocode:

python
Copy code
def load_corpus():
    # Load the corpus from a source (a file, a database, etc.)
    ...

def load_model(model_name):
    # Load the Transformer model
    ...

def encode_corpus(corpus, model):
    # Encode the entire corpus and return the embeddings
    ...

def save_embeddings(embeddings):
    # Save embeddings to a database
    ...

def main():
    corpus = load_corpus()
    model = load_model('model_name')
    embeddings = encode_corpus(corpus, model)
    save_embeddings(embeddings)
This approach separates each step into its own function for better code readability and maintainability. It also allows for flexibility in where the corpus is loaded from and how the embeddings are saved.

## 2. Creating question embeddings

The pseudocode:

def load_question():
    # Load the question from a source (user input, a file, a database, etc.)
    ...

def encode_question(question, model):
    # Encode the question and return the embedding
    ...

def main():
    question = load_question()
    model = load_model('model_name')
    question_embedding = encode_question(question, model)
    
    
This revision allows the question to come from any source, not just direct user input.

## 3. Using ChatGPT as a predictor and saving response to ChromaDB

def load_chatgpt_model():
    # Load the ChatGPT model
    ...

def generate_response(question, doc, chatgpt_model):
    # Generate a response using the ChatGPT model
    ...

def save_response(response):
    # Save the response to a database
    ...

def main():
    question = load_question()
    doc = get_related_doc(question)
    chatgpt_model = load_chatgpt_model()
    response = generate_response(question, doc, chatgpt_model)
    save_response(response)
